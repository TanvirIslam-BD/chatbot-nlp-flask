With the integration of generative AI technology such as natural language processing, or NLP, chatbots can understand questions and respond based on the data they have collected.

A special program called a ‘transformer’ acts as the brain of the chatbot.

The transformer comprises a large language model, or LLM, that helps the chatbot understand the input question and generate the human-like response as the output.

To build the chatbot, you must select an LLM based on the chatbot’s purpose. Other important parameters for choosing an LLM include licensing, model size, training data, and performance and accuracy.

Transformers and LLMs work together within a chatbot to enable conversation.

In a chatbot application, the back-end server will receive the prompts from the front-end interface and feed them to the chatbot, which will process the prompts.

In this project, worked on creating a simple chatbot using Facebook’s Blenderbot model and Hugging Face’s Python library, Transformers.
